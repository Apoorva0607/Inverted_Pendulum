# Inverted_Pendulum

An implementation of inverted Pendulum system using self balancing bot. Initial parameters for the control system were simulated in 
Matlab. The hardware implementation was done in Arduino with L293D, IMU(Gyroscope and accelerometer). The feedback from the sensor 
was sent to PID system to create a closed loop stable system.
